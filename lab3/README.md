**Assigned: 09/28/2020**

  

**Due: 10/19/2020 11:59 PM EDT**

  
  

In the lab assignments for CS4420/6422, you will implement an end-to-end toy database management system codenamed BuzzDB. All the labs are written in C++17. We recommend using an IDE for the labs (e.g., [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

  

For the third lab, you will implement the B+Tree data structure. We have provided you with a set of unimplemented functions. You will need to fill in these functions. We will grade your code by running a set of system tests written using [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)). We have provided a set of unit tests that you may find useful in verifying that your code works.

  

We **strongly recommend** that you start as early as possible on this lab. It requires you to write a fair amount of code!

  

##  Environment Setup

  

**Start by downloading the code for lab 3 from Canvas.**

  

We will be using a Linux-based Operating System (OS) for the programming assignments. **Make sure you use Ubuntu OS (version 18.04) for running your code.** We will be testing your code on this version of the OS. If you do not have native access to this OS, you should create a virtual machine (VM) instance on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Follow the instructions given [here](https://linuxhint.com/install_ubuntu_18-04_virtualbox/) to set up the VM.

  

Here's a list of software dependencies that you will need to install in the OS.

  

```

apt-get install -yqq cmake

apt-get install -yqq llvm

apt-get install -yqq clang-tidy

apt-get install -yqq clang

apt-get install -yqq clang-format

apt-get install -yqq valgrind

apt-get install -yqq libgl-dev libglu-dev libglib2.0-dev libsm-dev libxrender-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxext-dev

```


##  Getting started

###  Description

In this lab, you will implement a B+-Tree index for your database using the header `src/include/index/btree.h`.

The B+-Tree must support the following operations:
- `lookup` Returns a value or indicates that the key was not found.
- `insert` Inserts a new key-value pair into the tree.
- `erase` Deletes a specified key. You may simplify the logic by accepting under full pages.

You will use page ids and the buffer manager instead of pointers to resolve child nodes in the tree. You can assume that the `buffer_manager` methods `fix_page` and `unfix_page` work as described in the lecture. We added a fake buffer manager that allows you to test your code without I/O, so you can focus only on implementing the B+-Tree.


###  Implementation Details

The index should be implemented as C++ template that accepts the parameters **key type**, **value type**, **comparator** and **page size**.
Note that this task does not use a dynamic **page size** but compile-time constants.
You therefore have to implement the B+-Tree primarily in the header `src/include/index/btree.h` but you are able to compute a more convenient node layout at compile-time.

You can test your implementation using the tests in `test/unit/index/btree_test.cc`.
The tests will instantiate your B+-Tree as `BTree<uint64_t, uint64_t, std::less<uint64_t>, 1024>`.


###  Build instructions:

Enter BuzzDB's directory and run

```

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

make

```

###  Test Instructions:

To run the entire test suite, use:

```

ctest

```

ctest has a flag option to emit verbose output. Please refer to [ctest manual](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#ctest-1).

  

We have provided all the test cases for this lab. Gradescope will only test your code against these test-cases.

Similar to labs 1 and 2, your implementation will be checked for memory leaks. You can check for memory leaks using valgrind.

```

ctest -V -R btree_test_valgrind

```


##  Detailed Instructions

### Code structure

You will implement the B+-Tree in the `src/include/index/btree.h` file. You are provided with three functions in the skeleton code for the three operations introduced above.   
- `std::optional<ValueT> lookup(const KeyT &key)` - looks up and returns the value of the node with key specified by the parameter `key`.  
- `void insert(const KeyT &key, const ValueT &value)` - Inserts a new key-value pair specified by the parameters `key` and `value` into the tree.
- `void erase(const KeyT &key)` - Deletes the key specified by the parameter `key`.

In addition to these functions, we have also provided the skeleton code for structures that represent different nodes in the B+-Tree:
- `Node` - This is the base structure for all the nodes in the B+-Tree.
- `InnerNode` - This structure should be used to represent the *inner* nodes of the tree.
- `LeafNode` - This structure should be used to represent the *leaf* nodes of the tree.

 Note that `InnerNode` and `LeafNode` inherit members from the base `Node` object.
 
 Following are some of the important members from `InnerNode` and `LeafNode` that you will need to implement:
  - `static constexpr uint32_t kCapacity` - The capacity of a node.
  - `std::pair<uint32_t, bool> lower_bound(const KeyT &key)` - Get the index of the first key that is not less than than a provided key.
  - `void insert(const KeyT &key, uint64_t split_page)` - Insert a key.
  - `KeyT split(std::byte* buffer)` - Split the node.
  - `void erase(const KeyT &key)` - Erase a key (Used only with leaf nodes).
  - `std::vector<KeyT> get_key_vector()` - Returns the keys (Used only while testing your implementation).
  - `std::vector<uint64_t> get_child_vector()` - Returns the child page ids (Used only while testing your implementation).



### Algorithmic details

This is a rough outline of the steps you need to follow to implement the above methods.

* Lookup
    1. Locate the leaf node corresponding to the key.
        1. Start with the root node.
        2. Is the current node a leaf?
           - if yes, return the current page.
           - if no, find next node to traverse (hint: use `inner_node->lower_bound` method).
           - repeat b until leaf node is found.
    2. Once leaf node is found, find first entry â‰¥ search key (use *binary_search*).
    3. If such entry is found, return it, else return no key is found.
    
* Insert
    1. Create a new root if needed(code snippet provided).
    2. Locate the appropriate leaf page (same as step (i) in `lookup`).
    3. Starting with the leaf node, execute the following actions.
    4. Is there free space on the node(leaf/inner)?
        * If yes, insert entry and stop (use `node->insert`).
    5. Split the node(leaf/inner) into two (use `node->split` method).
    6. Insert key into the appropriate node(leaf/inner).
    7. Insert return value of `node->split` as separator into parent.
        * If the parent overflows, follow steps 4 through 7 on the parent node until node with free space is found.
    
    Note: 
        If any node in the process does not have a parent, create new root and update its children.
    
* Erase
    1. Lookup the appropriate leaf page (same as step 1 in `lookup`).
    2. Remove the entry from the current page (use `leaf_node->erase` method).
    (note that `erase` becomes lot easier in our case because we allow under full pages)

 
 
 * Capacity - Here, you will implement the logic to compute the capacity of a given node.

##  Logistics

  

You must submit your code (see below) as well as an one-page writeup (in `REPORT.md`) describing your solution. In the writeup, mention 1) the design decisions you made, and 2) the missing components in your code. We will award partial credits based on this writeup (if you are unable to finish the implementation before the due date or if it fails any test cases).

  

###  Collaboration

  

This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is allowed.

  

###  Submitting your assignment

You should submit your code on Gradescope. We have set up an autograder that will test your implementation. You are allowed to make multiple submissions and we will use the latest submission to grade your lab.

  

```

bash submit.sh <name>

```

  

***Important***

Do not add additional files to the zip file, use the script above.

  

###  Grading

95% of your grade will be based on whether or not your code passes the autograder test suite. 5% is for code quality. We will award partial marks for submissions that fail the autograder test suite (based on the writeup).
